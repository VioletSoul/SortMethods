## üè∑Ô∏è Algorithms Overview

| Algorithm             | Avg. Complexity | Stable | Description                                             |
|-----------------------|:---------------:|:------:|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Bubble Sort           | O(n¬≤)           | ‚úÖ     | Simple, educational, rarely used in practice           |
| Selection Sort        | O(n¬≤)           | ‚ùå     | Minimum swaps, not stable                              |
| Insertion Sort        | O(n¬≤)           | ‚úÖ     | Good for nearly sorted arrays                          |
| Merge Sort            | O(n log n)      | ‚úÖ     | Divide and merge, requires extra memory                |
| Quick Sort            | O(n log n)      | ‚ùå     | Fast, but not stable                                   |
| Heap Sort             | O(n log n)      | ‚ùå     | Heap-based, not stable                                 |
| Cocktail Sort         | O(n¬≤)           | ‚úÖ     | Improved bubble sort, bidirectional                    |
| Comb Sort             | O(n¬≤)           | ‚ùå     | Faster than bubble, reduces "turtles"                  |
| Counting Sort         | O(n + k)        | ‚úÖ     | For integers in a limited range                        |
| Radix Sort            | O(nk)           | ‚úÖ     | Digit by digit, for numbers/strings                    |
| Shell Sort            | O(n log n)      | ‚ùå     | Improved insertion, depends on gap sequence            |
| Binary Insertion Sort | O(n¬≤)           | ‚úÖ     | Insertion with binary search                           |
| Timsort               | O(n log n)      | ‚úÖ     | Python built-in, hybrid algorithm                      |

## üí° Notes

- For most tasks, it is recommended to use Python's built-in methods: `sorted()` and `list.sort()`, which implement Timsort.
- The implementations are for educational purposes and may not be optimal for large datasets.
- All examples are tested on Python 3.7+.
